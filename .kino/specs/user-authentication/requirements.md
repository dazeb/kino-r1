# User Authentication - Requirements

## Overview

This specification defines the requirements for implementing user authentication in the Kino AI extension.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: User Login
- Users must be able to authenticate using API keys
- The system must securely store API keys using VS Code's SecretStorage
- Invalid API keys must be rejected with clear error messages

### FR-2: Session Management
- User sessions must persist across VS Code restarts
- Users must be able to log out and clear stored credentials

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Security
- API keys must never be stored in plaintext
- All API communications must use HTTPS
- Authentication failures must be logged without exposing sensitive data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can configure API key in settings
- [ ] API key is stored securely
- [ ] Authentication works with DeepSeek API
- [ ] User receives clear feedback on authentication status
